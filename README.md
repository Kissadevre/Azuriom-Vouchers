# Vouchers for Azuriom

Vouchers is an Azuriom plugin for creating redeemable codes and granting one or more rewards to the player who redeems them.

## Reward types

- Shop points.
- Shop packages and products.
- Commands dispatched through Azuriom's native RCON or AzLink server bridges.
- Internal Azuriom roles.

## Architecture

- Voucher codes are encrypted at rest and indexed through a normalized keyed hash.
- Voucher codes use 8–14 URL-safe letters, numbers or hyphens; generated codes use the `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` format.
- Public links can prefill the redemption form with `?code=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` without redeeming automatically.
- Date windows, global limits and per-user limits are stored on each voucher.
- Every voucher can contain multiple ordered rewards.
- Every redemption creates an immutable execution ledger for its rewards.
- Administrators can pause every redemption globally and configure a per-IP attempts-per-minute limit.
- Administrators can optionally expose a Vouchers shortcut in the authenticated user dropdown; it is disabled by default.
- Voucher redemptions automatically use Azuriom's configured reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha or Turnstile protection.
- The administration panel exposes the complete redemption ledger with recipients, actors, IP addresses and delivery states.
- Shop is an optional dependency; package rewards are available when Shop is enabled.
- External package and server-command delivery is claimed once; uncertain attempts require review and are never retried automatically.
- Server commands use one execution-ledger entry per command and support the safe `{player}` and `{name}` recipient placeholders.
- Recipient placeholders accept 1–64 ASCII characters: the name must start with a letter, number or underscore, then may also contain dots or hyphens. Other names are rejected before any command is sent.
- Remaining rewards continue after an uncertain attempt so that an unrelated reward is not lost; ordering is therefore not guaranteed after an interrupted external delivery.
- Each voucher accepts one internal-role reward, which can be combined with every other reward type. It is an atomic upgrade that never downgrades an account, replaces an administrative role or grants a role with administrative access.
- Internal-role rewards intentionally update Azuriom only. Discord linked-role synchronization is not executed inside the voucher transaction.

Azuriom's scheduler must be running. Vouchers registers `vouchers:deliveries` every five minutes to process pending external rewards, reconcile abandoned claims and repair aggregate states.

A normal return from a server bridge is recorded as `dispatched`, not as confirmed execution: neither RCON nor AzLink provides an end-to-end acknowledgement. If a bridge throws after an attempt begins, the reward is marked uncertain and is never retried automatically to avoid duplicating the command. The “wait until online” option is available only for AzLink servers.

## Development status

The plugin is under active development and is not ready for production use yet.

Currently implemented:

- Secure voucher persistence and reward execution ledger.
- Administration CRUD with generated or custom codes.
- Administration submenus for settings, voucher codes and redemption logs.
- Configurable global redemption switch and per-IP rate limiting.
- Native Azuriom CAPTCHA verification whenever a CAPTCHA provider is configured.
- Date windows, global limits, per-user limits and authentication mode.
- Multiple ordered Shop point rewards.
- Optional Shop package/product rewards with a zero-cost payment audit trail.
- RCON/AzLink command rewards with one-attempt dispatch and an auditable uncertainty state.
- Internal-role rewards with monotonic promotion and privilege-escalation safeguards.
- Public redemption for signed-in users or guests targeting an existing account.
- Atomic point delivery with per-request idempotency.
